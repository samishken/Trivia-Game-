Great work overall! The actual functionality of the app works well. The project could use a bit of cleaning up. First and foremost, fix your readme! Adding media queries and/or flexbox to make your page resize better would be a big improvement as well. Lastly, A bit of tidying up in the javascript would go a long way, make your comments more concise.
